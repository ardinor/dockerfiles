### Mojibake Docker Compose file ###

Docker Compose file for Mojibake that brings a database and mojibake up with separate data containers for each and a link between the two.

Can't seem to use underscore in service names...

TO START:

cd to the directory and start the containers

    cd mojibake/

    docker-compose up -d
